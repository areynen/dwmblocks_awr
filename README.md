My hacked on version of dwmblocks:
implemented diffs are as follows:

* Status CMD for getting commands from clicking placement in DWM
    https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/

# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
# modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.
